This Program enables to create a contact including name, surname, phone number, address and
this data are kept in database.
I have written the program with Python using PyQt5 library.
I have used labels, lineedits and pushbottons to crate the first page.
To show the data I have used QTable.
The program is consist of 2 pages, the first one is responsible for to create contact and
the second one to show it.
